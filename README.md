# Getting Started with Image Slide App

To dry run this project, users must have npm and node installed in their system. If not please install them.

Steps to follow:
* Run the server first
    * npm i
    * npm run app
* Start the client
    * npm i
    * npm start    

## Improvements that can be made to this project.

* Add persistence to the server. Currently I have just developed this project by only using memory. Hence server restarts will lose all the information.
* Use websockets to get real time updates about image capture and focus. Used short polling to simulate real time updates.
